 ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to implement Express concepts to create an application that connects front-end and back-end. This application allows the user to write and save notes, allowing them to keep track of tasks that need to be completed. While building this project, I became comfortable using Express to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests. I learned how to implement proper communication between the front and back ends.
